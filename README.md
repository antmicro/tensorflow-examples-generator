## TensorFlow Lite Micro Google examples generator

This is a GitHub action-based repo for extracting TensorFlow Lite Micro examples to separate repositories.

At the moment it generates sources for Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (based on nRF52840) and pushes them to a [separate repository](https://github.com/antmicro/tensorflow-arduino-examples/).
